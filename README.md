# Hate-Speech-Detection
🎯 Introduction

Hate speech and offensive language on the internet have become major concerns in recent years. This project focuses on detecting hate speech in text data using machine learning and deep learning models. The system is capable of distinguishing between:

✅ Neutral Speech – Non-offensive, safe language
⚠ Offensive Language – Potentially harmful but not necessarily hate speech
❌ Hate Speech – Strongly offensive, targeting specific individuals or groups

The model is trained on real-world datasets, such as Twitter comments, Reddit discussions, and online forums, to ensure accurate classification. The final system can be integrated into social media platforms, content moderation tools, and online discussions to flag harmful speech.
